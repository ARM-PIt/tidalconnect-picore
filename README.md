# Tidal Connect for PiCorePlayer
>

piCorePlayer is a very small Music OS, only about a few tens of MB in size, and operates entirely on RAM.
Installing Tidal Connect on piCorePlayer can significantly increase the size of your OS, adding about 100MB. If you're not too concerned about that, give it a try. This version only supports 32-bit.
